## Case Study 1: Feature Engineering with Categorical Variables in Practice using R

### Overview
This case study aims to enhance my data science skills by focusing on feature engineering with categorical variables. The dataset used can be accessed http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/bank.zip.

### Techniques Applied
In this project, I explored various techniques to transform categorical variables into numerical ones, which is crucial for improving machine learning model performance.

#### Examples of Techniques Used:
1. **Creating a New Column**
   - Example: Creating a new numerical column based on categorical data.

2. **Dummy Variables**
   - Example: Converting categorical variables into dummy variables (binary indicators).

3. **One Hot Encoding**
   - Example: Transforming categorical variables into a one-hot encoded matrix.

4. **Feature Cross**
   - Example: Creating new features by combining existing ones, enhancing model complexity.

### Importance
Feature engineering with categorical variables is fundamental in data science as it allows algorithms to interpret categorical data, thereby improving model accuracy and performance.

### Conclusion
This case study provides foundational knowledge for data scientists. Mastering these techniques enables effective preprocessing and transformation of categorical data, essential for building robust machine learning models.
